# DataScience-Python
This is an implementation of the most well-known methods of Machine learning with movie reviews.

Here, I present a brief demonstration of my domain in machine learning and pandas proficiency in Python.
Using the following methods to train a model to determine if the review of a movie is positive or negative in general: SVC (support vector machine), Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and logistic regression. In the end, I compare the performance of each learning method to this case and show the results of optimization with the SVC method, but I have to mention that this optimization just adds a tunning factor, making it a little bit worse than the standard one.
